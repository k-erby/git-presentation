# git-presentation

This slide deck was made for a UVic Webdev workshop to teach basic and
intermediate git and Github skills.


### Workshop Information
- ECS 124, UVic
- 6:00pm - 7:30pm


### Revisions For Next Time
- Walk through Linux commands (and Windows stuff)
- Speak to setting up your email and name on a fresh git
- Branching is hard for new users, so spend more time on that (that's where the major hurdle was)
- Also, more time throughout the workshop on reassurance, since it's easy for beginners to feel lost
